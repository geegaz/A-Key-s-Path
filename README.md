*previously "Out of Control(s)"*

### Build your way with your own keys.

With your 3 movement keys (Left, Right, Jump) available at the bottom of the screen, you can **drag them in the world to use them as platforms**. But don't use too many, or you could run out of movement options !

Because as soon as one is placed, you **can't use it for movement**. It will be locked until you retrieve the key from the world.

*This game was created as part of the GMTK Game Jam 2020. The theme was "Out of Control" - I took it as "you run out of controls" !*
