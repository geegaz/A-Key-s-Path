*Welcome to the official repository for the game "A Key(s) Path". <br> Here, you can find all jam and post-jam releases in the [Releases](https://github.com/geegaz/GMTK_Jam_2020/releases) section of the repository, or browse the code.*


# A Key(s) Path
*Use your movement keys as platforms in the world !*

### Build your way with your keys.

You have 3 movement keys - Left, Right and Jump - available at the bottom of the screen. You can **drag them in the world to use them as platforms**. But don't use too many, or you could run out of movement options !

Because as soon as a key is placed, you **can't use it for movement**. It will be locked until you retrieve it from the world.

*A Key(s) Path is one of the winners of the GMTK Game Jam 2020, with the theme "Out of Control". It reached 6th place overall and was featured in GMTK's video*
